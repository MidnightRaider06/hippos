ðŸ¦›hippOS is a hobby OS kernel that I will attempt to implement from scratch during Summer 2025 as a learning experience. I will document my progress over the summer in this README file including any challenges I face and resources I use.

I finished following the Bare Bones tutorial on OSDev Wiki to write a simple kernel for 32-bit x86. I got familiar with setting up a cross-compiler and using it to assemble object files and link them into a final kernel. I still have to figure out my next steps with this project, including how a project like this should be properly structured, what my target platform should be (32-bit or 64-bit), and the features I should prioritize first.
